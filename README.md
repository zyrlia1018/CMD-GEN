# CMD-GEN
Coarse-grained and Multi-dimensional Data-driven molecular generation (CMD-GEN). This framework bridges three-dimensional ligand-protein complex data with two-dimensional drug-like molecule data by utilizing coarse-grained pharmacophore points sampled from diffusion models, thereby enriching the training data for generative models. 
Through a hierarchical architecture, it decomposes the generation of three-dimensional molecules within the pocket into sampling of coarse-grained pharmacophore points, generating of chemical structures, and alignment of conformations, avoiding the instability issues associated with inherent in deep generative model-based generation of molecular conformations.
