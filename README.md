# CMD-GEN
Coarse-grained and Multi-dimensional Data-driven molecular generation (CMD-GEN). This framework bridges three-dimensional ligand-protein complex data with two-dimensional drug-like molecule data by utilizing coarse-grained pharmacophore points sampled from diffusion models, thereby enriching the training data for generative models.
